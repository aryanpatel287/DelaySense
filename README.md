# 🚀 DelaySense Masterplan
A real-time delay impact and SKU prioritization platform tailored for large-scale retail logistics (e.g. Walmart).

---

## 📌 Objective
Build a scalable, real-time dashboard that helps store managers identify, understand, and act on the impact of delayed deliveries—especially at the SKU level—to reduce loss, improve cold-chain handling, and optimize return pickups.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

### 1. Delay Detection Engine
- Compares ETA vs ATA of each truck.
- Flags delays (> threshold minutes)
- Maps truck to store and origin DC.

### 2. SKU Impact Analyzer
- Pulls digital manifest of each delayed truck.
- Cross-references delayed SKUs with store's shelf/backroom stock.
- Tags SKUs as:
  - Out-of-stock
  - Cold-chain
  - Pickup-linked
  - Perishable

### 3. Loss Estimator
Calculates per-SKU estimated loss:

```
loss = demand_rate x delay_time x unit_price
```

- Aggregates total loss per store, per truck, per region.

### 4. Action Recommendation System
- Suggests prioritized unload order.
- Flags critical cold chain & high-demand SKUs.
- Notifies pickup order handlers if delays affect fulfillment.

### 5. Return Pickup Prioritizer
- Identifies ready-to-return SKUs in backroom.
- Scores return value based on urgency, condition, and resale value.
- Suggests optimal return items to send back based on truck space and return value.
- **Prioritizes return items that must be delivered to vendors urgently (e.g., time-bound recalls, vendor return SLAs).**
- Flags high-priority vendor-bound returns that could be impacted by inbound truck delays, enabling smarter reverse logistics.

### 6. Live Dashboard & Visuals
- Interactive store map with delay markers.
- Popup with:
  - Delay time
  - Est. loss
  - Top SKUs
  - Action suggestions
- Charts:
  - SKU loss trends
  - Cold vs dry item breakdown
